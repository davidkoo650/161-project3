This project should have been more compatible with the school wi-fi. It was a big waste of time to figure out how to find the appropriate network to test our code after the project was released. Besides that, I think the project was fun and well-designed. The TAs did a great job with providing support despite the enormous amounts of work that they needed to cope with. Thank you so much for an educational semester!

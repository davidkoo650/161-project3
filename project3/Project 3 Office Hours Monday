Project 3 Office Hours Monday:

First submit, but attend office hours just to make sure that project is done correctly. 

1. Go over question1.pcap output and question1.txt solutions with TA. 

2. As long as firewall is triggered every time for ping.py I should be fine, correct?

3. Ask about traceroute output. Traceroute doesn't generate the same output every single time, but frequently generates the correct one.

4. Ask if my output for evade is correct? Multiple HTTP requests, occasional RST, and response from Nick's Server. Go over the evasion strategy grading scheme. Occasionally evade doesnâ€™t return any 404s.
